#
# This can be used to upgrade storage nodes to new version of ceph
#
# Before you start you need to stop puppet and
#
# *** ALL CEPHMONs MUST BE UPGRADED BEFORE STORAGE ***
#
# Mandatory input variables:
# * hosts (str): ansible node(s)
#
# ATTENTION: Upgrade one storage node at a time, otherwise cluster will stop.
# It's recommended to set
#
# ceph osd set noout
#
# Before upgrading. After upgrading node, the storage node will reboot. After
# all storages nodes have been upgraded, unset the noout flag:
#
# ceph osd unset noout
#
# Example:
# sudo ansible-playbook -e "hosts=test01-storage-01" lib/upgrade/cephmon.yaml
