# Ansible managment of himlar

Based on usage in [himlar](https://github.com/norcams/himlar) and with
[himlarcli](https://github.com/norcams/himlarcli)

# Inventory

Inventory files can be updated from foreman with $himlarcli/ansible_hosts.py

# Variables
Default values are in group_vars/all.yaml and can then be overridden in
group_vars/<loc>.yaml or group_vars/<loc>-<role>.yaml (or in host_vars/
as a last resort).

# Run
Always run with sudo and with hosts variable set on the command line.
All playbook should be stored under lib/ and hosts can be single hostname,
<loc> or <loc-role>. 

Example:

sudo ansible-playbook -e "hosts=bgo" lib/ping.yaml
